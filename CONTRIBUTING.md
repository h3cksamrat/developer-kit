As it is a private repo for now, you may have been a contributor with all the access but you must have to follow the contributing guidelines.

## Contribution Guidelines
1. You must have to make different branch to work on the fix/feature in the repo.
```
Semantics of the branch is:
fixOrfeature/yourname/nameofthefixOrfeature

Example:
git branch feature-frontend/samrat/addingServicesSection
```
2. You must submit a pull request as you'll be finished working on the fix/feature
1. You must not make changes to the main branch of the main repo, unless your pull request has been reviewed by other members.
